A set in Python is similar to an unordered_set in C++. Basically having the following traits :

1. Mutable : Is liable to change. Elements can be appended to or removed from this data structure. Since it is mutable, we can apply functions such as ______ [dqwq].
2. Not a Sequence : This is not a sequence like list or tuple.
3. Contains Homogeneous Elements : Can contain only a single type of elements.
